  - Contains uppercase letters

## ðŸ§  How It Works

The app uses:
- `char.IsUpper`, `char.IsLower`, `char.IsDigit`  
- A custom string of allowed special characters  
- Conditional `if` statements for each rule  
- A `while` loop to reject empty input  
- Console output to explain what's strong or weak about the password
